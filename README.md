The Incredibles: Visualization of a cinematic narrative
=========================
Project done for Media and Methods of Project Representation II class under the orientation of Mauro Pinheiro. We were asked to develop a visualization of a cinematic narrative, and the movie chosen was “The Incredibles” (2009). In the software, the story of the movie is told through Mr. Incredible’s eyes — 5 moments of his life were chosen, and each illustration holds little clues about the character’s curent situation.

The software was planned in a way to, first, present a general overview, showing all the five moments all at once; and, by selecting one of the illustrations, the user gains access to more detailed information according to which clue was selected.

The whole software was developed on Processing and as an exercise in 
programming, without using any libraries. 

Version: TheIncredibles_E27
